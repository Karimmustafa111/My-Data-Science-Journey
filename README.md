## 🌟 Featured Project: E-Commerce Behavior Lens
**File:** `ecommerce_analytics.py`

A sophisticated simulation project analyzing **1,000 user sessions** for an e-commerce platform. It integrates **NumPy** for data generation, **Pandas** for feature engineering, and **Seaborn** to reveal hidden patterns.

### 📊 Key Visualizations
| Browser Analysis | User Segments | Correlation Matrix |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ![Browser Time](browser_time_analysis.png) | ![Age Dist](age_distribution.png) | ![Heatmap](correlation_heatmap.png) |
| *Time spent per browser* | *User demographics* | *Conversion drivers* |

> **Business Insight:** The analysis explores the relationship between "Time Spent" on the site and the likelihood of "Adding to Cart", helping marketing teams target the right audience.

## 🚢 Project 2: Titanic Survival Analysis (Real-World Data)
**File:** `titanic_eda.py` (or `titanic_eda.ipynb`)

This project marks my transition from simulated data to **real-world datasets**. Using the famous Titanic dataset, I performed a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to determine the factors that influenced survival rates.

### 🔍 Key Challenges Solved:
* **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values (Imputation) in `Age` and `Embarked` columns, and made strategic decisions to drop the `Deck` column due to excessive missing data.
* **Feature Engineering:** Analyzed the impact of "Class", "Gender", and "Age" on survival probability.
* **Visualization:** Used **Seaborn** to create compelling charts that revealed:
    * Women had a much higher survival rate than men.
    * 1st Class passengers were prioritized during rescue.

**Tech Stack:** `Pandas` (Cleaning & Manipulation), `Seaborn` (Visualization), `Matplotlib`.

### 📊 Key Visualizations

**1. Survival by Gender (Women vs Men)**
