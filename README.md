## ⭐ Featured Projects

### 1. 🛒 E-Commerce Behavior Lens
**File:** `ecommerce_analytics.py`

A sophisticated simulation project analyzing **1,000 user sessions** for an e-commerce platform. It integrates NumPy for data generation, Pandas for feature engineering, and Seaborn to reveal hidden patterns.

* **Key Tech:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
* **Insights:** Analyzed time spent per browser and correlation between adding to cart and purchase.

### 2. 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis (Real-World Data)
**File:** `titanic_eda.py`

This project marks my transition to **real-world datasets**. Using the famous Titanic dataset, I performed a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to determine the factors that influenced survival rates.

**Key Challenges Solved:**
* **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values in `Age` (Imputation) and `Embarked`, and dropped the empty `Deck` column.
* **Insights:**
    * **Gender:** Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate.
    * **Class:** First-class passengers were prioritized during rescue operations.

**Key Visualizations:**
* Survival Count (Countplot).
* Survival by Gender & Class (Barplots).
* Age Distribution (Histplot).

### 3. 💼 Corporate Sales Simulator
**File:** `sales_simulator.py`

Using **2D NumPy Arrays** to simulate and analyze branch performance.
* **Skills:** Matrix operations, Data Filtering, Critical Incident Detection.
* **Tech:** Python, NumPy.

### 4. 📝 Student Grades Analyzer
**File:** `grades_analysis.py`

A foundational script for statistical analysis using NumPy.
* **Skills:** Array creation, Basic Statistics (Mean/Max/Min).
* **Tech:** Python, NumPy.
